# Isomorphic React + React-Router + React-Hot-Loader

This is a demo app that demonstrates a minimal viable implementation of combining the following awesome projects:

- [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
- [react-router v0.11](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
- Isomorphic / Server-side rendering of React

I spent a fair bit of time banging my head against the wall trying to get webpack configured correctly here, and haven't yet touched on how to deal with production and builds yet. But AFAIK this is the first example of these being used together.

### Install

    npm install
    npm run dev
    open http://localhost:3000


### To Do

Production Stuff
Better docs for the Webpack configuration
