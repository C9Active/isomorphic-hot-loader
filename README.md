# Isomorphic React + React-Router + React-Hot-Loader

This is a demo app that demonstrates a minimal viable implementation of combining the following awesome projects:

- [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
- [react-router v0.11](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
- Isomorphic / Server-side rendering of [React v0.12](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/10/28/react-v0.12.html)

I spent a fair bit of time banging my head against the wall trying to get webpack configured correctly here, and haven't yet touched on how to deal with production and builds yet. Hopefully it helps people get new projects started -- I love React and react-hot-loader and react-router are two of the absolute best community modules that I've seen.

    npm install
    npm run dev
    open http://localhost:3000
